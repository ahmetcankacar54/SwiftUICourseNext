/* The main difference between Identifiable and Hashable is that conforming to Identifiable only says that your model has some unique identifier (which may be different every time you create an instance even with the same member values) whereas Hashable is a guarantee that an instance of your model will always produce the same hash value for a given set of member values. The latter is important because it allows you to use your model as the key in a dictionary as well as in SwiftUI view builders such as ForEach.
